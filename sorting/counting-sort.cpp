/**
 
 Counting short works by itrating through the input, counting the number of times each items occurs, and using those counts to compute an item's index in final sorted array.

/** 
    Properties of counting short
    1. Stable
    2. Time complexity : O(n + k)
    3. Space complexity : O(n+ k)
